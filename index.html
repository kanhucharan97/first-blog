    <p>then congratulations, you have come to the right place</p>
    <p>
      the benefits of reading books is just mind blowing. that means if you want
      to level up yourself then, reading book is the quickest way. right?
    </p>
    <p>
      of course not, this is because we change ourselves by watching things like
      movies, web series etc. but these are not influencing you in the right
      way.
    </p>
    <p>of course there are few good contents as well, but few,</p>
    <p>
      and that's why if not the quickest way but the quickerr way (no no i'm not
      convincing you to sell something using quickerr) or quick way is reading
      books
    </p>
    <p>
      so here are top 3 books you can start with in 2022 if you are fresher and
      solute to those who read books in regular basis, but these books are also
      valid to those as well
    </p>
    <p>
      because no one can change himself/herself by reading books for once only
    </p>
    <p>so here are the top 3 books which i recommend</p>

    <!-- summery part -->
    <h1 id="rdpd">rich dad poor dad</h1>
    <img

      alt="rich dad poor dad"
    />
    <p>
      in this book i'm not suggesting you that it's good to have 2 fathers, no
      offence guys.
    </p>
    <p>
      in this book the author has two fathers, before going into any conclusion
      let me tell you that the author has one biological father(poor dad) and
      another one (rich dad) of his friends father.
    </p>
    <p>
      in this book the author compares between rich mindset and poor mindset
    </p>

    <h1 id="etf">eat that frog</h1>
    <img
      src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pDx9j+xQL.jpg"
      alt="eat that frog"
    />
    <p>
      in this book the author says it is better to eat a frog first, before
      taking further actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      let me tell you, here the author says we should finish the most difficult
      task like eating a frog at the starting point of the day, when you have
      maximum willpower
    </p>
    <p>so please don't crush a frog for eating purpose.</p>

    <h1 id="htwfaip">how to win friends and influence people</h1>
    <img
      src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619Gn-+VNQL.jpg"
      alt="how to win friends and influence people"
    />
    <p>
      if you have a desire like you can win your friends as a trophy and make
      them your slave after reading this book, then let me tell you it's not
      going to happen literally
    </p>
    <p>
      but if you have the positive mindset towards others then you can influence
      any guy with this book's knowledge
    </p>

    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>this is a trial blog.</p>
    <p>i am sorry for my silly jokes and enjoy reading those books.</p>
    <p>
      because books can influence your life in a positive way, but for that you
      must read those books quite often.
    </p>
    <p>so thank you guys for reading my blog and i am glad that you survived</p>
